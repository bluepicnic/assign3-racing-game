# assign3-racing-game

This project was the final assignment for my first year of university. While I am proud of this work and I do believe the code inside is of good quality, is well indented and well commented, the specification for this game required that all the code be in a single cpp file, which is why it may not look as well laid out as my other work. In essence, this helps to show how far i've come in just under a year and how I've improved since.

Apologies for any confusion.
