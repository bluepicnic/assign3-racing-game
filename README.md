# assign3-racing-game

This project was the final assignment for my first year of university. While I am proud of this work and I do believe the code inside is of good quality, is well laid out and well commented, the specification for this game required that all the code be in a single cpp file, which is why it may not look as well laid out as my other work. 

Apologies for any confusion.
